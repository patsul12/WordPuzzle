#Word Puzzle App

##Description:
This site takes in a word or string and replaces the vowels with `-` characters

It then uses this "devoweled" string to create a new page on which the user tries to guess the correct word/string.

##Usage:
To install locally just clone the repo into the directory of your choosing

`git clone http://github.com/patsul12/WordPuzzle.git`

then run
`bundle install`

if the tests are not running you may need to install chromedriver
`brew install chromedriver`
